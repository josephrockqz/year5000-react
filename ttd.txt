Create logic for navigating to pages for articles
Modify MiddleBlock so that it shows a "RecyclerView" of articles
    - each article card should be clickable, have an image, title, subtitle
Render Header conditionally so it's different when not on landing page to avoid errors
    - Display logo in top right instead of tabs

---- After more work with D3 and webstie architecture has been done ----
Change Intro section to be an ArticleHighlight section
